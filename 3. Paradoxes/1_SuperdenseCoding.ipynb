    "> <p>It is an algorithm to send 2 bits of information with the help of quantum entanglement. Assume in a 2 qubit system, after creating a Bell state, Alice and Bob takes each one of the qubit and moves to the other universes. Now Alice wants to send 2 classical bit of information to Bob. So she encodes her qubit. On the other hand, to receive the information Bob has to decode (un-entangle) his qubit. And this will happen instantaniously. We have to keep in mind that Bob will never know when Alice will send him information. Moreover, Alice will never send him a text saying,\"Hi!, I've send you 2 bit of information, please decode your part.\" Instead, she could just text him the information.</p>\n",
